            This is an experiment for connecting speakers and audiences using
            AI. Any speaker can allocate a room URL for their audience, and
            regardless of the crowd being real or virtual, their webcams will
            share their dominant facial expression with the speaker in an
            audience summary. This helps the speaker gauge the feedback from the
            audience just as they would by looking out at the faces in the
            audience themselves.

            The Technology used for <strong>Enjoying The Show</strong> is
            straight-forward. Each audience member's browser client runs the
            webcam input through TensorFlow.js (via face-api) to identify the
            sentiment of the person. The dominant sentiment out of{' '}
            <em>
              Happy, Neutral, Surprised, Sad, Fearful, Disgusted, and Angry,{' '}
            </em>
            is identified and sent to an Amplify GraphQL server. The watch room
            URL has a GraphQL subscription to the designated room, and updates
            whenever a new audience member arrives/leaves or changes their
            facial expression. Using Amplify + TensorFlow.js we are managing
            real-time results of hundreds of client models with a single
            dashboard.
